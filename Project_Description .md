**Smart Airport Project**
The Smart Airport project aims to implement a system in C++ using programming concepts learned in class, such as classes, inheritance, exceptions, and more. The goal is to design an intelligent airport management system with the following features:

Light Sensor

A sensor that detects the light level inside the airport.
Based on the detected light intensity, the system can control a smart roof that opens or closes to optimize natural light usage.
Smart LED System

A LED lighting system that activates when the indoor light level is too low, ensuring adequate visibility for passengers and staff.
Connected Emergency Button

A button that, when pressed, triggers an alarm and notifies the relevant public safety authorities, such as the fire department.
Distance Sensor for Aircraft Positioning

A sensor that measures the distance of an aircraft from its designated position near the passenger boarding bridge (finger).
This system can also send data to confirm whether an aircraft is present at a specific gate.
LCD Display for Pilots

A screen that provides distance feedback to pilots, helping them park the aircraft accurately.
The display will also show flight-related information, such as the current time, date, and flight details.
It can display messages from the control tower, ground crew, or airline staff to the pilots.
The project will use object-oriented programming to model each component, allowing modular and maintainable code. Error handling with exceptions will be implemented to manage unexpected scenarios, such as sensor failures or communication errors.

This Smart Airport project will simulate the integration of various technologies into a functional system, promoting safety, efficiency, and sustainability in modern airport operations.
